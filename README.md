# Getting Started With ASP.NET Core Series


## Controller Action return types in ASP.NET

ASP NET Core offers different return types for the Web API Controllers. Each of these return types has its own use cases. The 3 main return types are
    1. Specific Type
    2. IActionResult
    3. Generic ActionResult

In this project, we will dive into each of these return types and when it's most appropriate to use each return type.
